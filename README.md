# Photoacoustic-Tomography---Breast-Cancer-Detection
Overview

This project implements a breast cancer detection system using Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify breast tissue images as benign or malignant, helping in early detection and diagnosis.

Features

Deep Learning-based Detection: Utilizes CNN for accurate classification of PAT images.

High-Resolution Imaging: Leverages the advantages of PAT for clear imaging of breast tissues.

Automated Analysis: Reduces manual effort in medical diagnosis.

Web-Based Interface: Users can upload images for real-time predictions.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

Database: MySQL

Web Framework: Django

Image Processing: OpenCV, NumPy

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable for UI)
